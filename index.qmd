**Welcome to my website!**

I am a professor of economics at the [University of Canterbury](https://www.canterbury.ac.nz/).

My teaching and research focus on data analysis. Examples of my research and teaching can be found under tabs above.

As you might notice, I am experimenting with [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) and [Github](https://github.com/dataisdifficult).
